# JS Framework Comparative Analysis

## Framework Name (Next JS)

## Research Conducted By:

- **Spencer Tower** & **Joey Hernandez**

### Overall Score and Comments

- **Score (Out of 10)**:
  - We give it a 7


### General Comments

- We basically just followed what the docs said and made some changes to the existing code base. We cannot take full credit though as this was the same framework Jacob demo'd for the class. We figured it couldn't hurt to keep that energy.1

- **Pros**
  - It's easy to work with
  - Not too complicated to implement

- **Cons**
  - We had to use it with Salmon Cookies
  - Required some refactoring

### Documentation

[Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs)

"Next.js is a React framework that enables several extra features, including server-side rendering and generating static websites. React is a JavaScript library that is traditionally used to build web applications rendered in the client's browser with JavaScript."

### Systems Requirements

- Node.js 12.22.0 or later
- MacOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux 
   
#### dependencies & core requirements

- The dependencies and requirements are added for you automatically, all you need to do is run the following:

- `npx create-next-app@latest` or
- `yarn create next-app`

### Ramp-Up Projections

- With a working knowledge of javascript and Node.js, even the most junior developer could get up and running with this framework, we estimate, in a matter of days if not hours.

### Community Support and Adoption levels

- Next. js is widely used by the biggest and most popular companies all over the world like Netflix, Uber, Starbucks, or Twitch. It's also considered as one of the fastest-growing React frameworks, perfect to work with static sites â€“ which was the hottest topic in the web development world lately.

#### Operating Instructions (How do I use this repo?!)

*this will also work for the 'live demo link'*

1. Run: `npx create-next-app@latest` 
2. Then: `cd salmon-cookies-nextjs` and replace the `src` folder generated by CRA with the `src` folder in this starter-code folder.
3. Run: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` to start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`
4. Visit: `http://localhost:3000` to view your application and verify all components are up.
5. Edit: `pages/index.js` and see the updated result in your browser.
